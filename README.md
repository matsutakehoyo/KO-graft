# KO-graft
scripts for the analysis of the retinal organoid KO grafts. This is a collection of complementary scripts for the paper "Genetically engineered retina for improved retinal reconstruction after transplantation". 

These include 

* Fiji/ImageJ scripts for image analsysis
* R scirpts for exploratory data analysis
* Stan scirpts for Bayesian inference
