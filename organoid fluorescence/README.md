Stan script (`growth_curve_nested.stan`) for the analysis of fluorescence signal increase in stem cell derived retinal organoids. The fluorescence signal increase across DD (diferentiation day) is modeled using the modified Gompertz curve, which has three main parameters. 

- $A$: maximum fluorescence intensity
- $\lambda$: The delay of onset, e.i., the begining of fluorescence increa. 
- $\mu$: the maximum fluorescence incerase rate
