# Light Response and Spontaneous activity

Scripts used to analyses the probability of the different categories of response or spontaneous activity.

- reseponse_clogit.stan is a conditional logit model used to analyse the response of RGCs. RGC responses were categorised to 4 types and the probability of obserbing each response type was modeled. 

- spontaneous_lognormal.stan is a lognormal model used to analyse the distribution of spontaneous RGC firing.
