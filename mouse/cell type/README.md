## Cell type analysis

Stan script used to analyse the number of a specific cell type in grafts. 

'binomial.stan' was used to analyse the content of Calbindin, Calretinin, Chx10, and PKC-a positive cells. 

'binomial_no_sex.stan' is essentially the same model but without sex as a predictor, used for the analysis of photoreceptor cells, and cone cells (SCGN), as these consisted of male or female only samples.
